## Problem

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.

## Example

There are  elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are ,  and . Results are printed as: arr = [1,1,0,-1,-1]

0.400000
0.400000
0.200000


## Initial Thoughts

1. create 3 variables for diff proportions, loop through array and find all the values then divide those values by the length of array and return.
