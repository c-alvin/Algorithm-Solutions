## Problem

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

## Example

"Dermatoglyphics" --> true "aba" --> false "moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)

isIsogram "Dermatoglyphics" = true
isIsogram "moose" = false
isIsogram "aba" = false


## Initial Thoughts

1. convert string to lower case.
2. create a hashmap, anytime a letter occurs more than once, return false.
